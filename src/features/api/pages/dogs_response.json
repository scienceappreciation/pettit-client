No/low shedding. Happy to sit and keep us company, but not negatively affected by being alone while we're working. Mostly calm and quiet but enjoys to play from time to time. Not necessary to be super intelligent or learn tricks, but I would feel more at ease if they would obey a call to stop or come to me.\n\n**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**\nI have very limited knowledge and experience of breeds, so any interest is purely cosmetic. I think something similar to the maltese my partner's parents have would work for us - she's generally calm and likes to sit with or near you, super excited when they come home or she sees someone familiar, enjoys playing, only really barks at loud noises and some visitors. Never seen her aggressive to human or animal, more likely to be scared of them. On the down-side she becomes sad and disinterested in everything when in-laws are away for a long time, can ignore commands, and has quite frequent digestive issues.\n\n**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**\nIdeally to be able to come to me or to stop. Anything else is an added bonus.\n\n**6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?**\nNo interest for the dog to be in sport or work.\n\n\n-Care Commitments\n\n**7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**\nAbout 4-5hrs per day (30 minutes before work and about 4hrs in evenings). But most of our time at the weekend. \n\n**8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**\nI guess avg 1.5-2hr per day. I think a short walk in the morning + longer walk in the evening and playing at home. On the weekend we can do longer or more frequent exercise. We have a dog park nearby but I\u2019d be a bit worried as it typically only has larger dogs and I'd feel unsafe due to my lack of experience.\n\n**9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**\nI'm willing to try/learn grooming at home, could see brushing once per day. We would be willing to pay for professional grooming also. \n\n\n-Personal Preferences\n\n**10) What size dog are you looking for?**\nSmall - I would like to be able to pick them up with ease - so at most about 10kg (22lbs). \n\n**11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**\nIdeally no/low shedding. Not a lot of barking since we live in an apartment, fine occaisonally if they're excited/scared. Slobber is a bit gross but I think would become accustomed to it with it being \u2018my\u2019 dog.  \n\n**12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**\nNot a requirement, but would be nice to have them feel 'free'. \n\n\n-Dog Personality and Behavior\n\n**13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**\nSnuggly.\n\n**14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?**\nA bit of both. We have quite a sedentary lifestyle so it would be nice if it could enjoy just sitting and keeping us company, but also ideal if they don't have to depend on us for entertainment if we can't give them attention or while we're at work. \n\n**15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**\nCuriosity/excitement but ideally we could calm/stop them with an order or by picking them up if needed.  I think it's ok if they get energetic, go to door, sniff, \u2018stand\u2019, but preferably not uncontrollably running/jumping or non-stop barking or growling.\n\n**16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**\nYes \u2013 I would be highly motivated to work on this so we can enjoy going for walks and being around dogs of friends/family members.\n\n**17) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?**\nI am totally inexperienced so can't really say. Ideally would like to avoid damage to our home/furniture as a lot of it is new.\n\n\n-Lifestyle\n\n**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**\nMon-Fri 9 hours approx. (9am to around 6pm). Work is close and we're quite flexible so we could visit home to see the dog during work hours if needed. \n\n**19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**\nSimilar to my own, I think my partner would prefer the dog being more cuddly and playful. We'd share the responsibilty of care. \n\n**20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?**\nNo other pets, no plans for any more.\n\n**21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**\nNo, there's no kids in our home or social circles. \n\n**22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**\nWe own the apartment &amp; no restrictions. It has a fairly big balcony so they wouldn't have to be 'indoors' when we're gone if they don't drive the neighbourhood crazy barking/whining. \n\n**23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**\nGreece - I\u2019m not aware of any laws which would impact us. \n\n**24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**\nSummers usually around 35\u00b0 up to 45\u00b0 in heatwaves (95-113\u00b0F). Winters typically around 10\u00b0, can go as low as -5\u00b0 (50-23\u00b0F)", "author_fullname": "t2_2gohl6yb", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for help/recommendations for first dog (apartment-based, quite sedentary, and working typical 9-5)", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "[Breeds] \ud83d\udcddRecommendation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "breeds", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_16yrhz0", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "[Breeds] \ud83d\udcddRecommendation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 2, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696338540.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dogs", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Will this be your first dog?

This will be my first dog while living alone.\n\n2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\n\n* No preference, but I would prefer the dog to be a puppy/young when I get it.\n\n3)  Describe your ideal dog.\n\n* I would like a dog that has a decent amount of energy and enjoys going on runs, hikes, mountain bike trips etc. It should also be pretty independent as I work full-time. (I can come home during lunch for a quick walk during the day, so they will be alone for approximately 4 hours at a time.) They should be loving and playful with people and other dogs.\n\n4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\n\n* German Shorthaired Pointer (I had one as a kid, so I know how much energy they have and that they make good running/hiking partners), I'm just a bit wary because of my smaller yard that they might get a bit frustrated during the day when alone. \n* I also like Boston Terriers; the ones I have interacted with seem pretty independent, and the owners said they do fine at home alone for a few hours a day. However, I'm not sure if they will be okay with running/hiking due to their short snouts, especially in the summer heat.\n\n5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\n\n* Just some basic obedience and following commands. doing some park runs with me, and maybe some trail running when I'm on the mtb.\n\n6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\n\n* Not really, but I'm willing to try things like agility etc, if its something that the dog will enjoy.\n\n**Care Commitments**\n\n  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\n\n* Approximately one hour in the morning before I go to work for a run.\n* Half an hour at lunch for another walk.\n* Another hour in the afternoon for another walk or going to the park. \n* I can also do training, playing fetch etc at night at home.\n* Multiple hours per day on weekends\n\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  \n\n* Same as above.\n\n9)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\n\n* I'm willing to brush the dog maybe once or twice a week, and I'm open to doing grooming at home. I'm also willing to pay a professional for grooming.\n\n**Personal Preferences**\n\n10) What size dog are you looking for?\n\n* Medium to large.\n\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\n\n* Minimal.\n\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\n\n* It's not the end of the world, but I would like them to be able to go off-leash.\n\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\n\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\n\n* I'm open to either, but I don't mind either way.\n\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?\n\n* I'm open to either, but I don't mind either way.\n\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  \n\n* An excited greeting is fine, as long as they can be trained not to jump on people.\n\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\n\n* No.\n\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?\n\n* Excessive barking &amp; separation anxiety.\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\n\n* Approximately 4 hours at a time during the week, less during weekends.\n\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? \n\n* None.\n\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?\n\n* No.\n\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\n\n* No, but they should be fine with kids.\n\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\n\n* Rent, no restrictions.\n\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\n\n* South Africa, and not that I'm aware of.\n\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\n\n    Summer (December to February):\n\n    Average high temperatures: 28\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C (82\u00b0F to 93\u00b0F)\n    Average low temperatures: 15\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C (59\u00b0F to 68\u00b0F)\n\n    Winter (June to August):\n\n    Average high temperatures: 19\u00b0C to 23\u00b0C (66\u00b0F to 73\u00b0F)\n    Average low temperatures: 5\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C (41\u00b0F to 50\u00b0F))\n    Average low temperatures: 5\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C (41\u00b0F to 50\u00b0F)\n\n**Additional Information and Questions**\n\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\n\n* I live in a apartment with a small yard that the dog will have access to during the day (about 60m\u00b2 or 650sq/ft),", "author_fullname": "t2_ipti9", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Looking for medium to large size [Breeds] that fit an active lifestyle, but does not mind some alone time during the day.", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "[Breeds] \ud83d\udcddRecommendation"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "breeds", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": true, "name": "t3_16yttkp", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 0, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "[Breeds] \ud83d\udcddRecommendation", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 0, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696344320.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dogs", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1)  Will this be your first dog?

The girl seems to be pretty happy and collaborates with me(the smaller one of the males also does), she lets herself be cleaned up, she doesn't take off her anti-pest collars, she's used to having a harness and following me even without it, but I can't even appreciate her because whenever I try to clean her (or her brother) the bigger dog comes in and starts barking and growling untill it devolves into a fight, and this happens even if I try to pet them one at a time for more than 3 seconds each.\n\nIt's clear I cannot give them a happy life, and my family isn't willing to help with it, I want to give them away, but given they would be extremely hard dogs to look out for I wouldn't know where to even look, I genuinely believe euthanasia would be a better option for the bigger male than continuing to live an anxiety ridden life without hope of finding a better home, but that obviously is my last possible option.\n\n\nSome important context, I am almost 18, but I have zero economic indipendency, I'm currently looking for a job, but money won't be coming in for a while, and my parents won't bother spending for the dogs well being, I live in Italy, so if you have any  local places I can call up to try to find a solution o would appreciate it. The dogs are not big, they weigh less than 10kg I think, maybe closer to 7kg, only one of them is aggressive.\n\nMy plan would be to look for a dog shelter and ask what I can do, if I can leave the two males to them in hopes of them finding a better home, my mom says that they would live an even worse life in there, so I'm considering, instead of a shelter, something that is owned by a single person, that may have a bigger outdoor area to make the dogs play (I can't remember the English name of the profession, something like breeder, but not a breeder, I think).", "author_fullname": "t2_kxid3iqzl", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I don't know what to do with my dogs", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "[Misc Help]"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/dogs", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "help", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_16xvx2p", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "[Misc Help]", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 3, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1696251285.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.dogs", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tldr: found female dog, family didn&amp;#39;t get her sterilized, now we have three dogs, one has anxiety issues and is aggressive, the other male is scared of him, and I can&amp;#39;t even pet the girl without the big guy starting a fight with his brother.

The girl seems to be pretty happy and collaborates with me(the smaller one of the males also does), she lets herself be cleaned up, she doesn&amp;#39;t take off her anti-pest collars, she&amp;#39;s used to having a harness and following me even without it, but I can&amp;#39;t even appreciate her because whenever I try to clean her (or her brother) the bigger dog comes in and starts barking and growling untill it devolves into a fight, and this happens even if I try to pet them one at a time for more than 3 seconds each.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clear I cannot give them a happy life, and my family isn&amp;#39;t willing to help with it, I want to give them away, but given they would be extremely hard dogs to look out for I wouldn&amp;#39;t know where to even look, I genuinely believe euthanasia would be a better option for the bigger male than continuing to live an anxiety ridden life without hope of finding a better home, but that obviously is my last possible option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some important context, I am almost 18, but I have zero economic indipendency, I&amp;#39;m currently looking for a job, but money won&amp;#39;t be coming in for a while, and my parents won&amp;#39;t bother spending for the dogs well being, I live in Italy, so if you have any  local places I can call up to try to find a solution o would appreciate it. The dogs are not big, they weigh less than 10kg I think, maybe closer to 7kg, only one of them is aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan would be to look for a dog shelter and ask what I can do, if I can leave the two males to them in hopes of them finding a better home, my mom says that they would live an even worse life in there, so I&amp;#39;m considering, instead of a shelter, something that is owned by a single person, that may have a bigger outdoor area to make the dogs play (I can&amp;#39;t remember the English name of the profession, something like breeder, but not a breeder, I think).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false,

If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\n\n* No! I grew up with a rescue mutt and chihuahua. I didn\u2019t train them myself. \n\n2)\tDo you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\n\n* My family rescued the two dogs we had. No experience with either. Looking into a breeder this time around. \n\n3)\tDescribe your ideal dog.\n\n* I\u2019m a solo girl in NYC - ideally a protective dog that is very smart and receptive to training, but can also relax from time to time without eating my couch or shoes. Lol. \n\n4)\tWhat breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\n\n* DOBERMAN (protective, smart, trainable) or BERNEDOODLE (cuddly, sweet, I think smart)\n\n5)\tWhat sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\n\n* training with heel off leash, retrieval, etc. I\u2019d send to a school and learn how to reinforce the training on my own. Ideally I\u2019d like a pretty high level of training. \n\n6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\n\n* No competition, but I\u2019d like to the dog to be okay in crowded areas with distraction and still be able to adhere to commands. \n\n**Care Commitments**\n\n  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\n\n* 3-4 hours (walking, socializing) or more. I\u2019m around most of the day and will be with the dog. \n\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  \n\n* 2-4 hours. I walk regularly (i\u2019m around the home most of the day, so can be out with the dog). I would run errands with my dog and I also live near multiple dog parks and dog runs\n\n9)\tHow much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\n\n* Yes!\n\n**Personal Preferences**\n\n10)\tWhat size dog are you looking for?\n\n* Large &gt;80lbs \n\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\n\n* I\u2019m a pretty clean person, so I think it\u2019ll be a little tougher at first but will adjust. Barking would be harder for me as I live in a building \n\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\n\n* Very important. I\u2019m not sure how often I\u2019d do it though I\u2019d like the option\n\n**Dog Personality and Behavior**\n\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\n\n* a little snuggly and loving, but also a working dog\n\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?\n\n* eager to please \n\n15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  \n\n* I would expect the dog to be at the door, but not jump on guests\n\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\n\n* how aggressive?! Lol\n\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?\n\n* a lot of barking (I live in a building)\n\n**Lifestyle**\n\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\n\n* usually not during the day (I\u2019d take him with me), but at night possibly for a few hours if I go to dinner. I can arrange a walker\n\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? \n\n* no one else in the house, just me!\n\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?\n\n* no\n\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\n\n* no\n\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\n\n* no\n\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\n\nNYC (apartment but I\u2019m outside a lot) / Miami (have a house with a yard)\n\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\n\n* summer 80s F / winter 20s F\n\n**Additional Information and Questions**\n\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\n\n* I\u2019ve always leaned toward a Doberman for safety purposes. I\u2019m 5\u20196/125 lbs and often walk around at night or during the day in nyc, which can be scary at times. I recently sat next to a very well trained service bernedoodle and began to consider it in my search (plus no shedding!). I\u2019m just not sure if I\u2019ll feel \u201cprotected\u201d enough or like I have \n\nOften travel private, so bringing pup with me wouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\n26) Feel free to ask any questions below.\n\nI\u2019m open to other breeds. I\u2019ve just mostly been exploring these.

If he were the only dog in the house, this would be a breeze as he's already 7 months old, neutered, and potty trained. His previous owners chose to give him up due to him becoming an excited tinkler after his neutering. They got him neutered at a little after five months old, which is too early in my opinion, but the excited tinkling isn't an issue for us and we're sure he'll grow out of it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur first dog (my first dog ever) is 2.5 years old... he's a morkie and is only 5 to 5.5 lbs (he was the runt). He's such a good dog, but pretty high energy. He plays with other dogs (mostly just one other dog) that family members own, frequently. He's never met anyone he hasn't liked and tends to get along with every dog we've introduced him to. His best friend is another morkie who is 6 or 7 pounds, 5 years old and has little more of a moody temperament. Despite their different personalities, they get along and know each other's limits.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe had been debating about a second dog for about year. Not because anything is wrong with our first, I love him to death, but more so because we saw how happy he was with other dogs and wanted to get him a companion and someone to burn extra energy with. We do our best to play with him every evening, but sometimes we don't do that as well as we should and we feel bad about it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen we brought home our dog #2, we made sure to greet our first dog as normal and let them sniff each other out. We put #2 down to see how they'd interact and it was not at all what we expected. #1 seemed pretty stand off-ish and #2 wanted to check out the house first. Once #2 did a lap, he noticed #1 and ran over to him. #2 is already about the same size as #1 (5lbs and should get to about 8lbs), maybe a little bigger, and being a puppy still really wants to play in the puppy way: jumping around, play biting, tackling, etc. This was very overwhelming to #1 and he immediately tried to get away. We intervened, picking up #2. We didn't scold him or get upset since he didn't do anything wrong, but we knew at that point it wasn't going to be as easy as we expected it to be to acclimate these two.\n\u00a0\nSince then, we've put up gates around the house to separate the two. We still give them a lot of time in the same room but only when #2 is on leash and we're around. #2 tries to lunge at #1 when they get close and does so with his mouth open. This is probably the part that is so difficult for me because I can't imagine #1 getting hurt. When lunging happens or when #2 is barking and whining because he can't get to #1, we correct it with a quick gentle tug and take him to a quiet corner of the house and sit there for about a minute. We are very conscious that lunging, play biting, and tackling #1 can be self-rewarding, positive behavior for #2 and try to prevent it as much as possible. In order to redirect him and give him other positive behaviors to associate with, we've started doing several training sessions (on leash right now) a day with #2 to help improve his ignorance behaviors. When he chooses to make eye contact with us instead of watching #1 or waiting for him to get close: treat. When he chooses to sit or lay with us instead of pursuing #1: treat. When he listen to commands (sit): treat. He seems to be getting it.. even after only 48 hours he does seem to be able to go longer without trying to get to #1. We plan on slowing allow more time with each other, more close contact, and increase the length of training sessions.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDoes anyone have a similar experience? Should we be worried that this isn't going to work out or something is going to happen to dog #1? Are we on the right track training-wise? Any advice or suggestions?
